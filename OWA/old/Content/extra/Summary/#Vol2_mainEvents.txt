-the invasion/Eisen found Lily.
-the seperation/the goodbye.
-the reveal
-"Fake Lily"/Klein enter/Merlin appeared.

//main events with the focus on Youmu.

.Lily encounter
.Eisen encounter. (A weird customer with a weird request.)
-[Eisen's event] (Eisen is attacked - "A non-marked is attacked in the middle of the street. He seems to be your customer.", Youmu is blamed to be the cause by Klein, and he seriously trying to kill her, if not for Riel stopping him.)
-Lily's event.
-The ambush/runaway.

// Total rewrite of Lily - turn her into "Miniaris"
Best friend betrayal (she had to, the other option is to be killed). Her and her mother is sold to slavery. The mother died, and she went apeshit-crazy.
She got a big (not bad) power inside of her, which she want to use for revenge. 

-Normal life of Lily -> revealed to be demon.
-Sold as slave -> mother died -> fight back -> power awaken -> Attack Eisen, being controlled.
-Continue to head to the city with Eisen's group. (Cant kill because "look what she done to the one who tried to kill her"). She is trying to take revenge on the village, everyone noticed that.
-When they reach the edge of Human's territory. (Eisen is heading to a Demon town). Eisen changed his mind - wont be freeing her anymore.
(Eisen cant accept that she might destroy an entire village)
=> frustrated, Lily decides to attack Eisen. (Eisen is kinda soft toward the slaves). Lily cant even fight Eisen properly. 
(Lily dared Eisen to kill her, since she know that her power will go crazy if her life is in danger. Eisen decides to not kill her on the spot, but not for the reason Lily thinks)

(controlled Klein attack the team?)

// Gender flip Lily -> Hugo.

-Normal life -> the reveal
-Sold as slave -> mother died -> power awake -> attack Eisen -> stopped by Riel
-want to use his power for revenge -> Eisen refuses to free him -> attack Eisen -> almost killed by Eisen.
(reaching the City of Alicia. Eisen realize that he cant confirm the existence of the girl named Alicia.)
-Controlled Klein attack.
The team are safe because of the presence of "Youmu", a girl who know about Eisen's Soul Breaker, and had broken the soul herself. (Youmu save Hugo from Klein)
-Eisen decide to move to "the safe city".

// Vol 3 main events
-Arrival at "the village" 
(Hugo's old village) (they meet Youmu "by coincidence" on their way). Because of Hugo's reaction, Eisen decides they will not enter the village.-> the villagers drag them into the village by force anyway (they are being vigilant of Demon's infitrate.). Using the "Check magic devide" on them show Eisen and Youmu to be Human, rest are Demons, but they are all Eisen's slaves. ("I figured that you guys would not be comfortable with so many Demons, so I decided to stay outside of the village.")
-Hugo past come to haunt him: his father being abusive. The kid throw rock. People talking bs... -> Lily come to Klein to ask about Hugo's mother.
(She cannot ask Eisen, since there is a change he will accuse her of heresy?)
-Then the army and the church come and surrounded the place? They command to "bring out the heretic". Who the fck is the heretic?

(All of the team could be considered heretics. But the church cannot know their route, Eisen already chosen a very roundabout route for this very reason.)

Eisen wrack his brain to think about it. He mostly asked Hugo.
->Reveal when Klein mention about a Human girl who asked about Hugo.
"Oh no..."
Then chaos break.
Eisen is trapped inside of the DemonLord? He is restricting its power, so the DemonLord is much weaker. (Now its time for Hugo and Youmu to shine)

## Lily and Riel has somewhat the same personality (mostly bcuz Lily's presonality is not laid out yet)

## Klein's personality is still vague.
