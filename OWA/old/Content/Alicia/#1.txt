When Kou and Alicia were sent to the past, God of Earth realized that letting them Gods know about this matter will make things very complicated. (Two person who actively acting against them are troblesome), so the God of Earth decided to change their memory in a way that conceale the "travel to the past" thing?

(Seem like doing that bear no fruit tho)

Both of them got broken memory in regard of the other.

=======================
^^not very useful
=======================

Alicia is a "talentless" student of the Demon academy. Got bullied often because of that.
She know a lot of magic, but can only proficiently use very few magic.
Her only family/friend is her brother, who is often not home.

Mel (Merlin) wants to destroy the Demon Lord forever, so she find the ones who is holding the "heart", and capture them.
Is Merlin a Cursed? Yes, she is. She is a part of an organization that consist of only Cursed.

Archie is the first target, he became the target for multiple experiments, and all of them failed. The organization's only way left is to used him as a sacrificed at the altar, where the god will "grant any wish to the one who offer life to him"

(
Technically, he grant wishes for anyone who sacrificed to him, using their own life. Therefore, the one who is granted wishes is the brother. 
He wished for Alicia's happiness, which lead to this entire shenanigan.
So, the god, heard his wish, decides to save Alicia, and maybe take some inhabitants if convenient enough. 
--> The time Kou is summoned is slightly after when Alicia's brother (Archie) died.	
)

That one failed, of course. Alicia became the next to hold the core.

The organization need to find the next holder of the core ASAP. Not to kill, but to supervise.

Result is that Merlin, who see the "heart" inside of Alicia, insist of coming along. 

===========================
How can she figured that Merlin (or the organization) is the one killed Archie?
Human body take around 2 years to decompose, that mean Alicia cannot find out her brother's remain in the tomb or something similar.

accidentally eavedrop seem more plausible.
============================

Kou was summoned before that happened.
He was weak, one of the weakest Hero ever, compare to other Hero, that is. When he compare himself with others people (that is not a hero), he realize that his grow rate is considerable faster... which is weird.
However, he is still "weak" compare to other heroes.

(Kou has considerable weaker link to the Enhancer, therefore he : cannot use magic very well, and experience grant is considerable slower.
But, the exp granting effect of the "Hero" title take full effect, stronger still as Kou himself doesnt use those exp, so he remains useful.)

============================

============================

So, they met in a dungeon, where they are trapped by weird space magic.
Moving wont help, teleporter (tis a magic device) wont help either. So, they gang up and... spend a few days together.
Alicia with very firm basic of magic, and Kou with knowledge in classical physics, they create some absurd "spell", firstly as a joke, then they reach "teleport magic".

With that (or rather, an modified version of it), they escaped the trapped space.

And they parted.

After that, both of them is like having a new pair of eyes.
They can see magic energy.
They can distinguish between a Human, a Beast and a Demon just by looking at them.
Both of them can see that, they have a different "look" toward others.
Their growth rate accelerate considerably.

Next time they meet is in the "Abyss".
Both of them saw a weird, disturbed space, and they step in.
Its a labyrinth, a very hard one, actually.

They wandered in there for a couple of days before bumping into each other.

(Their fighting style perfectly match each other, or rather, they purposely fight to match the other's style)

Its take a week, but finally they passed the labyrinth.

At the end of the labyrinth is a city, a hidden city with all of it inhibitants are Cursed.

They got captured the moment they reached the main gate. (suspisious looking people, dub)

They were dragged to the person in charge of the guards, who believed their story of getting lost in the labyrinth and end up here, not knowing where is this.

The captain ask them to do two things : Hide the fact that they're Human and Demon, and not telling anyone outside of this city. (Killing them is not required. The captain knew that the existence of the city cannot be hide forever, the best they could do is assure the outsiders that this place mean no harm.)

The city... is like from another world.

Magic devices are used extentively. Fighters are strong and unparalleled. A city of wonders, they could say.

Interesting city, sure. Finding the way out is a chore. The inhabitants dont know how to enter/leave the city. Even mister Captain, cuz nobody actually reach this place for who-know-how-long.

And they parted again.

But this time, they made a promise.

"Let's meet again, in this city."

---

They join the Dungeon Crawling Team, and go help the locals with their jobs.

The money they get in this city is unusable elsewhere, so their wealth accumulated.

With that money, they bought a small house in the city. (It's cheap, and they need a place to hoarde all the spoil)

They help the city with a invasion (from the Demon God). After which one of the elder, who know about their current status, offer to help them with the Enhancer. Both of them are now ridded of the real curse, and learnt about the gods.

The elder offered them to stay at the city, to become its inhabitants.

Both of them, reductantly, refuse.
They still have someone who they cared about.

"That's regettable. Though, the offer is still there. You can change your mind at anytime. The city will always welcome you.", he said.

But that is when their lives turn over.

Alicia become a insanely strong mage. But, as the core somehow disapeared, Alicia catch the attention of the one who want to destroy the core.

Alicia, using her over-the-top prowess, accidentally eavesdropped the info about her brother. 

Then she run, to their house in the hidden city.

Without the Enhancer, Kou is as strong as ever. The Demon Lord that happened to appeared (not Alicia, mind you) is easily defeated. Kou even manage to capture the Demon who is the host for the core.

But his companions cannot leveling as fast as before because enhancer is not there anymore.

Kou become a problematic piece.

Realize his companions true motives, he flet.

To their house in the hidden city.

---

They meet up. 
Dont know what to do, honestly. Kou doesnt know whether he can return to his home, Alicia doesnt know where to go now.

Alicia decided that she want to hear Merlin's answer directly. (She is confident that she cannot be defeated, even if it is a trap)

At meet-up time, she got sentimental and Kou have to take a hit for her.

-> They decide to settle in the city, but got ambushed and killed mid way?

=======================

^^ There are some unused protential:
- The Princess
- Merlin

VV not very good?
======================

It take considerable time to get out of that place, but during that time they has already learnt countless thing from each other.

Even after that, they still met often at the hidden city they found at the end of the abyss. (to Dungeon crawl together, and sometime join the Festivals there)

Kou with knowledge of Physics, and Alicia with knowledge of Magics. They created thousands of unique spells.
And their growth rate became phenomenal.

It doesnt take very long before Kou became the strongest "Human" in the history, and Alicia to became the strongest "Demon"

Thing gone South once they found out about the Demon Lord system, and the fact that Alicia is a Demon Lord.

Kou desperately find a way to save Alicia, but to no avail.
Alicia want herself to be killed (by Kou) before the Demon Lord can rampage.
That would be what happened if Merlin didnt interfere and ruined everything.

Well, Kou still killed the Demon Lord easily. That mindless monster cant even compare with a corner of Alicia.

Now, the Demon Lord is killed, Kou dedicated himself to finding a way to "cure" Demon Lord, if it happened once more.

He find out about the Soul, the Body Enhancer, and the Magic Core.
And about the fight between two gods.

That when all of Human decide to betray him.
