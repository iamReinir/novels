ARC 2 - HUGO
==================
Part 1 : Hugo's old life.
Hugo was a young hunter of a small, unknown village in the border of the Human's World.
His everyday job was to band up with other hunters of the village, then go hunt inside a "Magic Geyser", the magic "hole".
So far so good, Hugo's daily life include of hunting with the band, then go lovely dovely with his childhood friend.
Then one day, the party got lost in the "hole", then they were attacked by a weird looking monster. Hugo used his body to protect one of his teammate (who is also his bestfriend?) which injured him quite subtantially, (and incidentally breaking his "Enhancement" too). He also killed the monster, despite in a "confused" state.

(Normally, getting one big hit from this monster will break the enhancer, and almost definitely make the victim confused, and killed. Healing magic dont work on the Cursed, and all victim must be hit quite heavily to  so incidentally, the villager just think the attack inflict confuse and poison.
However, small attacks, or the ones that dont hit the torso dont break the enhancer.
Hugo's good, so he kept fighting despite losing his enhancer)
After the fight, Hugo had a major wound and felt a bit weird. The party members just bring him home for treatment, assume the weird feeling is due to the monster poison.
Take some time for Hugo to recover, however, the weird feeling wont go away.
He can see faint, weird "smoke" comming in of people.
The "Hole" split out a large amount of this smoke.
His movement was considerable slower, and so were his attacks. However, the monsters now dont even notice him. The villagers too, seeing Hugo is as hard as ever (they just assume that Hugo went through a lot of levels and now is a better assassin)

Life proceed. However, things is not quite as normal as they used to be.

People seem to "hate" him more than normal.
Bad mouthing even the simplest things. Party members lash at him for being "a hindrance".

(weird, weird stuff, init?)

Then one day, the Hero decide to visit the village. (Hero dude want to defeat the "hole", a high-risk low-reward-until-reaching-super-deep dungeon)
He had the "Pry" skill, so he can look at everyone status, he claimed.
But when he look at Hugo, there is nothing? Impossible, he had never seen this happened before. Even someone who had a status-hiding skill wont show nothing on "Pry".
Upon inquire with the Prince, Hero came to know that the conceale skill actually make a status blank, but normally ppl dont do that because it look suspisious asf (totally lying here). The man seem to use the skill without knowing that he got that skill.

Prince, otherhand, know that is a sign of a "Cursed". Therefore he plotting to pull Hugo back to the Capital.

Firstly, he suggest Hugo to attend the academy, as he got potential. But Hugo refuse because of his mother.

Secondly, the prince plotting to kill off the mother. He hire some bandit to attack just when every fighting force just left the village. The Hero, and to kill the mother. However, the plan busted, the bandits are somehow killed.

(there is this mysterious party of travellers who just arrive and inconveniently destroyed all the bandits.)

Out of ideas, the Prince decide to reveal everything. "Hugo is a Cursed. He cannot be allowed to live in this village.", he said. When one of Hero's companions about to kill Hugo, the Childhood-Friend Girl intercepted and begged him to be spared.

The Prince allowed Hugo to be spare, but he must serve the Royalty until his demise.

At least, thats what he trying to say if SOMEONE (Kou) did not jump in and offer to buy Hugo.

"In thats case, can I have him? As a slave, of course."
"With your party currently, bringing him along is a nuisance, yes? You cannot just leave him here when enter the dungeon. Incidentally, Im also need more slaves right now."
"He could kill you, you know. After all, he is a Cursed."
"Good point, then, shall your highness be the secondary master?"
(Secondary master : if the main master died, the mark moved to this master)
The Prince

Part 2 : the turning point

Then one day, the party got lost in the "hole", then they were attacked by a weird looking
monster. Hugo used his body to protect one of his teammate (who is also his bestfriend?) which injured him quite subtantially, (and incidentally breaking his "Enhancement" too). He also killed the monster, despite in a "confused" state.

Bad mouthing even the simplest things. Party members lash at him for being "a hindrance".
(weird, weird stuff, init?)
He is isolated with the rest of the village.
The only one he can actually talk with is his childhood friend.

Part 3 : Hatred

On that day, a traveller come to the village. He is a travelling merchant stopping for a rest, and he sell some good magic items.
On those item, these are those "status scrolls" that show a person current stat.
He bought one, and use them (secretly with the childhood friend)
However, the status scroll give out... "human", one word.
(They all know that mean he is a Cursed)
Hugo dont get it. Both of his parents are human, how can he be a cursed?
Nontheless, he asked the childhood friend to hide it.

The next day, all the villagers go haywire. All of their hatred point toward Hugo, to the point of unnatural.
Apparently, the childhood friend betrayed him.
Hugo is beaten to a pulp, almost killed, if its not for the merchant to offer to buy him.
He left before long. He seemed to intend to sell the Cursed to the royal palace, where Cursed is bought at a high price.
He merge his cargo with others merchants, to move through the "Forest" safely.
However, amid the fighting, defending cargoes of the "Adventurers", Hugo went berserk, killed several people (including the aforementioned merchant)
Noone was able to stop him. The monsters weren't helping too.
Then, Riel noticed the ruckus, then jump in and stop Hugo in one note.
(Riel currently had the apperance of a Beastmen.)
Her "master", Kou, decide to keep Hugo, despite everyone objection.

Kou and Riel were heading to the hidden city of the Cursed. But first, they stopped at a random city X.

The first thing Hugo done was to runaway from his new master, even tho Kou didnt mistreat him once.

Then, he met a man who said he will help him get his revenge.
==================
//Arc 1's incident is not very convincing 
==================
So, Gleen found out that Riel is a Cursed, and trying to take her? (The higher up seem to like them Cursed)
Riel interfered with his wrong doing while in dungeon, and he want to get his payback? (Gleen does shady stuff in dungeon.)
The old master see that Riel is strong, so he want her back? (manipulating dude)
