In a world of sword and magic, there was a pair of sibling living in a slum in the captital of a country. An older brother and a younger sister.

They were a family of choice. The older brother was a human, and the younger sister was a demon.

The brother, who got some talent, worked as an assassin for a big figure in the royal family. Because of his dirty job, he and his sister were protected even tho the sister was a demon.

Their life, overall, was very pleasant.

One day, he got a job: to assassinate the third Princess.
He failed. The princess herself was stronger than he imagined. He escaped the royal castle and ran toward his house, since he knew waht would happened to him and his sister as he had been found out.

He reached the small hub in the slum, but the guard were just a step behind him. A sword went throught his body, he collapsed right before his sister's eyes, then he lost consiousness.

He woke up in a dark and humid dungeon undergrond.
It turned out that the guard didnt actually want to kill him.

They said that they had her sister. If he wanted to meet her again, he had to finish the tasks given by them.
Desperately want to meet his sister again, he done assassination after assassination, now without even a pay.

The "last job" before he can meet his sister again, was to assassinate a wealthy and powerful merchant.

He failed. He didnt let down his guard. The merchant was strong.

Instead of being killed, he was captured by the merchant. Being kept barely alive under a deep dark dungeon, again.

His conciousness fading and returning again and again days after days under this hell. 
It seemed that this hell would never end, then he opened his eyes again, and saw his sister.

The little sister was saved by a man while she was wandering in the slave market.
He himself seemed to also being saved by him.

The brother wouldnt know what to do if she was actually gone. 

So the pair decided to pledge loyalty to the man.
