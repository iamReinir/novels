Vol1: (Riel) 
## Riel's betrayal and her decision to stay.
## 
		Vol 1 is basically done. Some finetunings are needed but it is good enough.

Vol2: (Lily)
## Lily's incident and her decision.

##
		The olde Lily is kinda not very dynamic. All she ever done is to take difficulties to the face.

		Lets the new Lily be "Miniaris". 
		
		Her life would be ruined by the Human. Therefore she has a burning hatred for them.	Eisen found her, and his kindness help her to contain her hatred.

Vol3: Desperation / Cruelty (Elise)
##
		Same problem like Lily. Too static.


		Vol4 and Vol5 is actually never built properly.

Vol4: Naivety / Indecision (Kou)
	His past, with all the beauty and the ulginess
Vol5: Vengeance / Apathy (Alicia)
	head to the future
