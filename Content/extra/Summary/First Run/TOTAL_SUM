1. Riel - Riel's betrayal / Riel's loyalty.

   .Riel's past is dubious:
   (Riel is well-educated and seem not familiar with slaves' way of live, definitely in the slavemarket for < 1 month since she would be dead before that. But she is a Demon? She seem oblivious about the world.)

   .Eisen's origin is dubious.
   .The world is terrible and Eisen is used to it.
   .Eisen has trust-issue.
   .He seem disconnected with others. His idealology is uncommon (maybe otherworldly?)
   Eisen : understand the world >< idealistic

   Eisen knowledge >< Riel naivety

   .At the end of Vol1, Riel commit to Eisen, Eisen learnt to trust Riel.

2. Hugo + Youmu - Klein's attack. / Demon General : Merlin.
   .Eisen still has trust issue, but now Riel could help him a bit. (softer Eisen, still hard tho)
   .Hugo wants to take revenge on a small village, which Eisen doesnt allow.
   .At the end, Klein and Youmu decide to join.
3. Liliana - Demon Lord's attack / Demon's King.
4. Ely - The hero apperance / attack The Prince.
5. Alicia - Eisen's "death" / Human's God.
6. Kou - The old world / the old times. / Final showdown.
