.The peaceful life of Hugo. -> the reveal that he (and his mother) is a "Demi-human". -> the entire village pour hatred on him, including his childhood friend (who had no other choice?). -> he fall into slavery. -> his mother died -> he go berserk. -> almost killed by guards -> inner power wake up.

(kinda similar to minaris)

.Eisen (actually Riel) catches Hugo before Hugo could do anything significant -> Offer to buy him, (since he IS a very rare demi-human) -> he got shut-up by Riel (who say "LET HIM SLEEP, OR ELSE I WILL END YOU", very intimidating.)

.Reaching the city, Eisen give him the "usual treatment". Hugo didnt appreciate it very much. (he is not originally a slave).
(Hugo constantly say about his hatred toward the village, to Riel?)

.At the day when Eisen want to release Hugo, he changes his mind, and decide to continue to keep Hugo. (which is a "heroic" decision, since keeping Hugo, a clearly unstable individual next to him is a move that hurt only Eisen)

.Hugo feels really annoy/surprise with Eisen's decision. In amid a mess, he meets a mysterious man (Human God posed as Klein). The mysterious man push Hugo to attack Eisen, since "killing the master will undo the mark". and "I will create a opening for you" 

.Then, Eisen come to see a "info-broker' (heavily-implied to be the mysterious man, even tho she is "a bit smaller").

.Once Eisen got the info from the info broker, he then proceed to overwork himself, moving non-stop for 3 days straight, then collapse in his room -> which is Hugo's chance.
.He did tried once, but stopped by Riel. Riel didnot tell Eisen about this matter, but the tension between Riel and Hugo intensified.

.Then, Hugo tried to contact with the info-broker, who he think is the mysterious man. He talk about how "the opening" is not actually an opening and how Riel, the only one he could trust is wary of him now.
.She talk as if she was the mysterious man. (with some weird parts). Then make a remark (You just didnt have it.)
