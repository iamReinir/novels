// Total rewrite of Lily - turn her into "Miniaris"
Best friend betrayal (she had to, the other option is to be killed). Her and her mother is sold to slavery. The mother died, and she went apeshit-crazy.
She got a big (not bad) power inside of her, which she want to use for revenge. 

-Normal life of Lily -> revealed to be demon.
-Sold as slave -> mother died -> fight back -> power awaken -> Attack Eisen, being controlled.
-Continue to head to the city with Eisen's group. (Cant kill because "look what she done to the one who tried to kill her"). She is trying to take revenge on the village, everyone noticed that.
-When they reach the edge of Human's territory. (Eisen is heading to a Demon town). Eisen changed his mind - wont be freeing her anymore.
(Eisen cant accept that she might destroy an entire village)
=> frustrated, Lily decides to attack Eisen. (Eisen is kinda soft toward the slaves). Lily cant even fight Eisen properly. 
(Lily dared Eisen to kill her, since she know that her power will go crazy if her life is in danger. Eisen decides to not kill her on the spot, but not for the reason Lily thinks)

(controlled Klein attack the team?)

// Gender flip Lily -> Hugo.

-Normal life -> the reveal
-Sold as slave -> mother died -> power awake -> attack Eisen -> stopped by Riel
-want to use his power for revenge -> Eisen refuses to free him -> attack Eisen -> almost killed by Eisen.
(reaching the City of Alicia. Eisen realize that he cant confirm the existence of the girl named Alicia.)
-Controlled Klein attack.
The team are safe because of the presence of "Youmu", a girl who know about Eisen's Soul Breaker, and had broken the soul herself. (Youmu save Hugo from Klein)
-Eisen decide to move to "the safe city".
