Kou is back to the old world.
But he lost all his memories.
His life is pleasant, but one thing is odd. His dream is strangely vivid, and emotional. He doesnt know why.
The more he's dreaming, the rickier he act.
Until he reach the end, and he realize that the dreams are his memories

He struggle to choose between this side and that side.
He chose that side.
